34,34,"Caucasus Research Resource Center - Armenia
TITLE:   Demographic Analysis Workshop
DURATION:  3 week
LOCATION:  Yerevan, Armenia
DESCRIPTION:   Demographic analysis and population projection represent
one of the cornerstones of public sector planning and private sector
market analysis at the national, regional, and local levels. Population
projections also provide the crucial denominator data needed for health
programs monitoring and evaluation. This workshop will strengthen the
participant's capacity: 
- to evaluate census, survey, and vital statistics data; 
- produce a consistent set of demographic estimates; 
- prepare national population projections for planning, monitoring, and
evaluation. 
The workshop will focus on the analysis of data from the 2001 census,
the 2000 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), vital statistics, and
other administrative data. However, special attention will be given to
the census and DHS data in order to maximize the timeliness and utility
of analytical products based on these data sources. Approximately two
days will be devoted to developing a design and outline for a 2001
census analytical report or series of reports. 
Participants will use the same U.S. Census Bureau and United Nations
demographic analysis and projection software used by staff of the Census
Bureau's International Programs Center to prepare estimates and
projections for the countries of Western Asia, including Armenia. 
REQUIRED QUALIFICATIONS:  Participants should be mid-level professionals
(Statisticians and Demographers) who would directly use official census
and demographic survey data in their day-to-day work. This workshop
would be most beneficial for those who make or use population
projections. Participants should have a university degree and be
computer-literate, using PCs on a daily basis in a Windows environment.
English language is helpful, but not required. 
Individuals from government, private, and academic institutions are
sought. Participants from ministries such as Education, Health, or other
ministries that depend on demographic data are encouraged to apply.
Individuals from mass media or NGOs (unless specifically interested in
demography), would not be appropriate for this course. 
COURSE OVERVIEW:  This workshop will be taught by demographers from the
United States Census Bureau. The course will be taught in English, with
consecutive translation provided in Armenian. The course is offered free
to qualified candidates. No housing, travel, or per diem allowances are
available. 
This is a three-week course, starting March 9th and finishing on the
26th. Classes will be held Tuesday through Saturday, except for the last
and final week, when classes will be held Tuesday through Friday. A
one-hour break will be given for lunch, with coffee breaks during the
day as appropriate. Potential candidates must be able to make the
three-week commitment that this course requires-absences for more than a
day would not be acceptable. 
APPLICATION PROCEDURES:   If you are interested in this course and feel
you meet the qualifications stated above, please contact CRRC for an
application form or submit the attached application form via e-mail tocrrc@.... You will be notified by February 20th if you have been

Introduction and Purpose of the RFA
IntraHealth International is an independent nonprofit corporation
affiliated with the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
IntraHealth has earned an international reputation for innovative
performance improvement and training activities that benefit a wide
variety of providers in such areas as family planning, reproductive
health, and safe motherhood. 
PRIME II is a global reproductive health project sponsored by the United
States Agency for International Development (USAID). A consortium of 7
international agencies implements the project with IntraHealth
International Inc. as the lead. Partners include Abt Associates,
EngenderHealth, PATH, Training Resources Group, American College of
Nurse Midwives and Save the Children. PRIME II currently works with the
government of Armenia to expand access to quality reproductive health
services at the primary level through development of updated national
policies and protocols and through pilot implementation of those new
approaches in Lori Marz. PRIME II's Human Immunodeficiency
Virus/Sexually Transmitted Infections (HIV/STI) project supports the
government of Armenia to strengthen its efforts to prevent further
spread of STIs in the population through preparing primary care
providers to offer integrated STI management and prevention services and
by educating communities around those primary care centers about
services and appropriate prevention practices. Since May, 2003 STI
Syndromic Management Guidelines and Algorithms were developed in close
collaboration with the Center of Dermatology, STIs and AIDS Prevention
and the Ministry of Health, RA. As part of an overall program aimed at
improving health services in sexually transmitted infection treatment
and prevention at the primary health care level, PRIME II has conducted
a Training of Trainers in STI Syndromic Management, based on the
above-mentioned guidelines. Participants who have undergone this
training will be responsible for conducting training of primary care
providers in selected primary care sites in Lori Marz. This Request for
Applications (RFA) invites applications on the implementation of a
community-based intervention to conduct community education campaign to
prevent/combat HIV/STI among community inhabitants in Lori Marz. The
applications are limited to local Armenian Non-Governmental
Organizations (NGOs) for projects of up to 6 months of duration to
provide informative/counseling/referral and other educational services
to the target community members. 
IntraHealth will be the entity awarding the subcontracts. The
subcontracts may be awarded to one or more Armenian NGOs who have proven
capability to carry out successful activities in the field of public
health and/or education. Awards will average $10,000 with a maximum of
$12,000 (Documented in-kind contributions are strongly encouraged).
The purpose of this program is to raise awareness and knowledge of the
population in issues related to the HIV/STI in professionally-accurate
and culturally-appropriate ways and to mobilize actions to tackle
HIV/STI. The program aims:
-  to increase the awareness of the link between STIs and HIV/AIDS, 
-  to demystify and destigmatize these diseases, to combat the myths and
taboos associates with them,
-  to promote prevention activities and practices,
-  to increase use of services for treatment of STIs. 
An important emphasis of the program is to provide referrals for
counseling and STI care management to the primary health care providers,

TITLE:   Kurt Schork Awards in International Journalism
DESCRIPTION:   The Kurt Schork Awards in International Journalism
recognizes independent and professional reporting that sheds new light
on controversial issues. Established in 2002, two $10,000 prizes are
awarded each year, one to a local reporter in a developing country or
nation in transition, and the other to a freelance journalist covering
international news. 
The stories can focus on conflict, human-rights concerns, cross-border
issues, or any other issue of controversy in a particular country or
region. 
Underwritten by the Kurt Schork Memorial Fund and Reuters, and
administered by the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism,
the prizes were created to honor Kurt Schork, an American freelance
journalist who was killed in a military ambush while on assignment for
Reuters on May 24, 2000, in Sierra Leone.
